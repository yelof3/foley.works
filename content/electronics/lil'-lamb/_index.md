I made this lil' lamb in preparation of the design and creation of the Pixel Lamb. In reality, it didn't really serve as a stepping stone for the big one, but it did give us something fun to look at while we worked on Wooly Fair things.

At some point after creating the physical layout I learned that I could create a custom map with .json. Once I figured that out, it started really looking nice. 

From there, I added an INMP441 I2S microphone, and to top it off, some faux fur fabric as the diffusion material.
